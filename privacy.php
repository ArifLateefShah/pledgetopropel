<p>Where the above table states that we rely on our legitimate interests for a given purpose, we are of the opinion that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests, rights or freedoms, given (i) the transparency we provide on the processing activity, (ii) our privacy by design approach, (iii) our regular privacy reviews and (iv) the rights you have in relation to the processing activity. If you wish to obtain further information on this balancing test approach, please contact Pledge2Propel’s&nbsp;<a href="mailto:connect@pledge2propel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Privacy Officer</a>.</p>
<p>We will process your personal data for the purposes mentioned above based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws.</p>
<p>To the extent you are asked to click on/check “I accept”, “I agree” or similar buttons/checkboxes/functionalities in relation to a privacy statement, doing so will be considered as providing your consent to process your personal data, only in the countries where such consent is required by mandatory law. In all other countries, such action will be considered as a mere acknowledgement and the legal basis of the processing of your personal data will not be your consent but any other applicable legal basis.</p>
<p>We will not use your personal data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes of which you have been informed, unless it is required or authorized by law, or it is in your own vital interest (e.g. in case of a medical emergency) to do so.</p>
<h3>Will we share your personal data with third parties?</h3>
<p>We may transfer personal data to our service providers, professional advisors, public and governmental authorities or third parties in connection with a (potential) corporate or commercial transaction. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Pledge2Propel’s internal policies. Pledge2Propel may also transfer your personal data to any of its global affiliates/partners in furtherance of any visits to our Pledge2Propel locations.</p>
<p>For example, we may disclose personal information to third parties for other business purposes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We share your information with third-party service providers that provide services to us, including billing, payment processing, customer service, email deployment, advertising and marketing, security and performance monitoring, maintaining or servicing accounts, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, research, data hosting, auditing, and data processing;</li>
<li>To protect and defend the legal rights, safety, and security of Pledge2Propel, our affiliates, users, or the public, including to protect against fraud and malicious activity; and</li>
<li>For other business purposes described in this privacy statement or for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, initial public offering, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Unless you are otherwise notified, any transfers of your personal data from within the European Economic Area (EEA) to third parties outside the EEA will be based on an adequacy decision or are governed by the standard contractual clauses (a copy of which can be obtained through the contact information included below). Any other non-EEA related transfers of your personal data will take place in accordance with the appropriate international data transfer mechanisms and standards.</p>
<h3>What about sensitive data?</h3>
<p>We do not generally seek to collect sensitive data (also known as special categories) through this site or otherwise. In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with data privacy law requirements and/or ask for your consent.</p>
<p>The term “sensitive data” refers to the various categories of personal data identified by data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent from you. These categories include racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, biometric or genetic data, sexual life or orientation, or criminal convictions and offences (including information about suspected criminal activities).</p>
<h3>What about data security?</h3>
<p>We maintain organizational, physical and technical security arrangements for all the personal data we hold. We have protocols, controls and relevant policies, procedures and guidance to maintain these arrangements taking into account the risks associated with the categories of personal data and the processing we undertake.</p>
<p>We adopt market leading security measures to protect your personal data. This includes (without being limitative):</p>
<ul>
<li>We hold an ISO27001 certification, which indicates that we adhere to the highest and strictest information security standards. This is a security standard awarded by the British Standards Institution (“BSI”) that serves as international certification that Pledge2Propel adheres to the highest and strictest standards. This certification is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (“ISMS”), and confirms that Pledge2Propel’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and our own information.</li>
<li>We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us.</li>
<li>We have regular penetration testing performed by a third party provider, which continues to show the strength of our technical defenses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where will your personal data be processed?</h3>
<p>As an organization with offices and operations across various parts of the world, personal data we collect may be transferred or be accessible internationally throughout Pledge2Propel’s business and between its entities and affiliates.</p>
<p>Any such transfers throughout Pledge2Propel’s global business take place in accordance with the applicable data privacy laws.</p>
<h3>What are the sources we get your personal information from?</h3>
<p>If we do not obtain your personal information directly from you, we may obtain it from the following sources: publicly available sources (registers or the internet), Pledge2Propel employees, contractors, (prospective) members of board of directors, shareholders, Pledge2Propel’s affiliates, subsidiaries and newly acquired businesses, employers of our contractors, public authorities, public websites and social media, previous employers, educational institutions, suppliers and vendors (including third party data providers).</p>
<p>In section 5, you can find more information on the sources of your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>
<h3>How long will your personal data be retained by us?</h3>
<p>We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary. We maintain specific records management and retention policies and procedures, so that personal data are deleted after a reasonable time according to the following retention criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>We retain your data as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you (in particular, if you have an account with us).</li>
<li>We will only keep the data while your account is active or for as long as needed to provide services to you.</li>
<li>We retain your data for as long as needed in order to comply with our global legal and contractual obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?</h3>
<p>You are entitled (in the circumstances and under the conditions, and subject to the exceptions, set out in applicable law) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to the personal data we process about you: this right entitles you to know whether we hold personal data about you and, if we do, to obtain information on and a copy of that personal data.</li>
<li>Request a rectification of your personal data: this right entitles you to have your personal data be corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
<li>Object to the processing of your personal data: this right entitles you to request that Pledge2Propel no longer processes your personal data.</li>
<li>Request the erasure of your personal data: this right entitles you to request the erasure of your personal data, including where such personal data would no longer be necessary to achieve the purposes.</li>
<li>Request the restriction of the processing of your personal data: this right entitles you to request that Pledge2Propel only processes your personal data in limited circumstances, including with your consent.</li>
<li>Request portability of your personal data: this right entitles you to receive a copy (in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format) of personal data that you have provided to Pledge2Propel, or request Pledge2Propel to transmit such personal data to another data controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the extent that the processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting Pledge2Propel’s Data Privacy Officer. Please note that this will not affect Pledge2Propel’s right to process personal data obtained prior to the withdrawal of your consent, or its right to continue parts of the processing based on other legal bases than your consent.</p>
<p>If, despite our commitment and efforts to protect your personal data, you believe that your data privacy rights have been violated, we encourage and welcome individuals to come to Pledge2Propel first to seek resolution of any complaint. You have the right at all times to register a complaint directly with the relevant supervisory authority or to make a claim against Pledge2Propel with a competent court (either in the country where you live, the country where you work or the country where you deem that data privacy law has been infringed).</p>
